# Order_book




How to run this
- npm install -g @angular/cli
- npm install --save
- ng serve
  
  
Done:
- Created 2 Queues for both buy and sell orders with a fixed length of twenty ( Always showing the last 20 orders that occured)
- Created 2 Queues also for buy and sell but they get updated each time there is a match.
- Created a Queue showing the last 30 matches.

What is missing : 
- The Match Queue is not sorted buy time creation
- The match Queue shows all the details in a table and not in after a click (in a modal for example).
